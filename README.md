This repo contains an analysis of my own blood sugar data to estimate the right ratio of insulin to inject per gram of glucose ingested.

## Notes

And here are some notes for when I do this again in the future:

* record volume of drinks as much as possible
* record precise alcohol content of drinks
* record alcoholic beverages that do not contain sugar (e.g. red wine)
* record numbers of fruits, or even better, weight
* record weight of sweet sauces (e.g. ketjap) 
* have a database of glucose content in some commonly used ingredients
* specify if raw or cooked (potatoes, pasta, noodles) for future self to remember
* always record new insulin (change of cartridge)
* use packageing whenever possible for carbohydrate content
